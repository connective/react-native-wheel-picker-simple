A simple Wheel Picker, rendered with native components on Android and iOS. For iOS, pickerIOS is used. Forked from [react-native-wheel-picker-android](https://github.com/KalonTech/ReactNativeWheelPicker).

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-feature-blue) This picker works inside scrollViews.

## Usage

```js
<View style={wheelPickerWrapperStyle}>
  <WheelPicker
    itemStyle={{
      marginTop: -30,
      backgroundColor: '#111111',
      color: '#EEEEEE',
      fontSize: 12,
      fontFamily: "YourFontName"
    }}
    selectedItemTextFontFamily={'YourFontName'}
    itemTextFontFamily={'YourFontName'}
    selectedItemTextSize={12}
    itemTextSize={12}
    selectedItemTextColor={'#EEEEEE'}
    indicatorColor={'#999999'}
    selectedItem={selectedIndex}
    data={onAddItem ? itemsModified : items}
    onItemSelected={this.onItemSelected} />
</View>

```

## iOS Specific style

`itemStyle` prop is applied only to iOS.


## Android Specific style

You can add styles conditionally based on OS

```js
let wheelPickerWrapperStyle = [gs.centerChildren, gs.row, gs.centerAlongFlex];
if(Platform.OS === 'android')
  wheelPickerWrapperStyle.push(s.wheelPickerWrapperAndroid;
```

## Limitations

- iOS Date Picker is not customizable i.e. background color, fonts, etc. cannot be changed. No dark theme ðŸ˜ž

- iOS Picker line color cannot be changed ðŸ˜Ÿ. At least it looks and feels okay in iOS, unlike the date picker.
